# A simple, opinionated set of deployment recipes for capistrano, using git, bundler and foreman to
# manage application deployments.

# Most of the documentation can be found with the [main recipe](lib/tomafro/deploy.html), while the
# [bundler](lib/tomafro/deploy/bundler.html) and [foreman](lib/tomafro/deploy/foreman.html) recipes document
# their extensions.

# The code is available [on github](http://github.com/tomafro/tomafro-deploy) and released under the
# [MIT License](http://github.com/tomafro/tomafro-deploy/LICENSE)
