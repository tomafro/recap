# Recap has a number of requirements on your server before you can deploy applications
# with it.  These include:
#
# - Each application needs its own account on the server.  The full account environment
#   is loaded whenever an application command or process is run, so this is the place where
#   other application specific configuration should happen.
# - Each deploying user needs a personal account on the server which they should be able to
#   ssh into.
# - This personal account needs to be able to `sudo`, both to switch to the application user
#   and to run other administrative commands.
